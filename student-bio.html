                <p>
                    I was a programmer for 20 years at Lincoln Financial Group, until they decided to 
                    basically outsource most of their IT Department.  I had recently accepted a new 
                    assignment on another team when they began laying off employees, so I was in the 
                    first "wave" of employees to be laid off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I was laid off, I have been attending my community college, trying to get updated
                    on all the newer technology.  This is taking a long time, however, and I have run out of
                    severance pay! So I am doing this boot camp to give me the confidence I need to get another
                    job.
